[Compare v0.9.0...v1.0.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.9.0...v1.0.0)

## 0.9.0 2022-01-26


### Changed

- [BREAKING] Support for ... was changed, now constructors with such signature are not considered
as pass-through because they can forward arguments to another method (flash-gordon in [#78](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/78))

- [BREAKING] Support for 2.6 was dropped

[Compare v0.8.0...v0.9.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0)

## 0.8.0 2021-06-06


### Added

- Support For `...` passthrough-args (@ytaben)

### Fixed

- Constructors with kwargs strategy properly forward blocks to super (mintyfresh in [#68](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/68))

### Changed

- [BREAKING] Support for 2.4 and 2.5 was dropped

[Compare v0.7.0...v0.8.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0)

## 0.7.0 2019-12-28


### Fixed

- Keyword warnings issued by Ruby 2.7 in certain contexts (flash-gordon)

### Changed

[Compare v0.6.1...v0.7.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.6.1...v0.7.0)

## 0.6.1 2019-04-16


### Fixed

- Allow explicit injection of falsey values (timriley in [#58](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/58))


[Compare v0.6.0...v0.6.1](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1)

## 0.6.0 2018-11-29


### Added

- Enhanced support for integrating with existing constructors. The kwargs strategy will now pass dependencies up to the next constructor if it accepts an arbitrary number of arguments with `*args`. Note that this change may break existing code though we think it's unlikely to happen. If something doesn't work for you please report and we'll try to sort it out (flash-gordon + timriley in [#48](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/48))

### Fixed

- A couple of regressions were fixed along the way, see [#46](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/issues/46) and [#49](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/issues/49) (flash-gordon + timriley in [#48](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/48))

### Changed

- [BREAKING] 0.6.0 supports Ruby 2.3 and above. If you're on 2.3 keep in mind its EOL is scheduled at the end of March, 2019

[Compare v0.5.0...v0.6.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0)

## 0.5.0 2018-11-09


### Changed

- Only assign `nil` dependency instance variables from generated `#initialize` if the instance variable has not been previously defined. This improves compatibility with objects initialized in non-conventional ways (see example below) (timriley in [#47](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/47))

  ```ruby
  module SomeFramework
    class Action
      def self.new(configuration:, **args)
        # Do some trickery so `#initialize` on subclasses don't need to worry
        # about handling a configuration kwarg and passing it to super
        allocate.tap do |obj|
          obj.instance_variable_set :@configuration, configuration
          obj.send :initialize, **args
        end
      end
    end
  end

  module MyApp
    class Action < SomeFramework::Action
      # Inject the configuration object, which is passed to
      # SomeFramework::Action.new but not all the way through to any subsequent
      # `#initialize` calls
      include Import[configuration: "web.action.configuration"]
    end

    class SomeAction < Action
      # Subclasses of MyApp::Action don't need to concern themselves with
      # `configuration` dependency
      include Import["some_repo"]
    end
  end
  ```

## 0.4.6 2018-03-27


### Changed

- In injector-generated `#initialize` methods, set dependency instance variables before calling `super` (timriley)

[Compare v0.4.5...v0.4.6](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.4.5...v0.4.6)

## 0.4.5 2018-01-02


### Added

- Improved handling of kwargs being passed to #initialize’s super method (timriley)


[Compare v0.4.4...v0.4.5](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.4.4...v0.4.5)

## 0.4.4 2017-09-14


### Added

- Determine name for dependencies by splitting identifiers on any invalid local variable name characters (e.g. "/", "?", "!"), instead of splitting on dots only (raventid in [#39](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/39))


[Compare v0.4.3...v0.4.4](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.4.3...v0.4.4)

## 0.4.3 2017-05-27


### Added

- Push sequential arguments along with keywords in the kwargs strategy (hbda + vladra in [#32](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/32))


[Compare v0.4.2...v0.4.3](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.4.2...v0.4.3)

## 0.4.2 2016-10-10


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where injectors for different containers could not be used on different classes in an inheritance hierarchy (timriley in [#31](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/31))


[Compare v0.4.1...v0.4.2](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.2)

## 0.4.1 2016-08-14


### Changed

- Loosened version dependency on dry-container (AMHOL)

[Compare v0.4.0...v0.4.1](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1)

## 0.4.0 2016-07-26


### Added

- Support for strategy chaining, which is helpful in opting for alternatives to an application's normal strategy (timriley in [#25](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/25))

  ```ruby
  # Define the application's injector with a non-default
  MyInject = Dry::AutoInject(MyContainer).hash

  # Opt for a different strategy in a particular class
  class MyClass
    include MyInject.args["foo"]
  end

  # You can chain as long as you want (silly example to demonstrate the flexibility)
  class OtherClass
    include MyInject.args.hash.kwargs.args["foo"]
  end
  ```

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with kwargs injectors used at multiple points in a class inheritance heirarchy (flash-gordon in [#27](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/27))

### Changed

- Use a `BasicObject`-based environment for the injector builder API instead of the previous `define_singleton_method`-based approach, which had negative performance characteristics (timriley in [#26](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/pull/26))

[Compare v0.3.0,...v0.4.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/compare/v0.3.0,...v0.4.0)

## 0.3.0, 2016-06-02


### Added

- Support for new `kwargs` and `hash` injection strategies

  These strategies can be accessed via methods on the main builder object:

  ```ruby
  MyInject = Dry::AutoInject(my_container)

  class MyClass
    include MyInject.hash["my_dep"]
  end
  ```
- Support for user-provided injection strategies

  All injection strategies are now held in their own `Dry::AutoInject::Strategies` container. You can add register your own strategies to this container, or choose to provide a strategies container of your own:

  ```ruby
  class CustomStrategy < Module
    # Your strategy code goes here :)
  end

  # Registering your own strategy (globally)
  Dry::AutoInject::Strategies.register :custom, CustomStrategy

  MyInject = Dry::AutoInject(my_container)

  class MyClass
    include MyInject.custom["my_dep"]
  end

  # Providing your own container (keeping the existing strategies in place)
  class MyStrategies < Dry::AutoInject::Strategies
    register :custom, CustomStrategy
  end

  MyInject = Dry::AutoInject(my_container, strategies: MyStrategies)

  class MyClass
    include MyInject.custom["my_dep"]
  end

  # Proiding a completely separated container
  class MyStrategies
    extend Dry::Container::Mixin
    register :custom, CustomStrategy
  end

  MyInject = Dry::AutoInject(my_container, strategies: MyStrategies)

  class MyClass
    include MyInject.custom["my_dep"]
  end
  ```
- User-specified aliases for dependencies

  These aliases enable you to specify your own name for dependencies, both for their local readers and their keys in the kwargs- and hash-based initializers. Specify aliases by passing a hash of names:

  ```ruby
  MyInject = Dry::AutoInject(my_container)

  class MyClass
    include MyInject[my_dep: "some_other.dep"]

    # Refer to the dependency as `my_dep` inside the class
  end

  # Pass your own replacements using the `my_dep` initializer key
  my_obj = MyClass.new(my_dep: something_else)
  ```

  A mix of both regular and aliased dependencies can also be injected:

  ```ruby
  include MyInject["some_dep", another_dep: "some_other.dep"]
  ```
- Inspect the `super` method of the including class’s `#initialize` and send it arguments that will match its own arguments list/arity. This allows auto_inject to be used more easily in existing class inheritance heirarchies.

### Changed

- `kwargs` is the new default injection strategy
- Rubinius support is not available for the `kwargs` strategy (see [#18](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-auto_inject/issues/18))
